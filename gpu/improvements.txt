Improvements

Bug fixes (mostly due to using the Jaglavak engine for reference, then switching to different implementation/architectural design):
    Playout perspective bug - caused engine to sometimes maximize opponent's score
    Tactical solver perspective bug - all hard tactical tests failing with very negative scores

Methodology fixes:
    Increased number of simulations:
    Default simulations: 10k → 350k
    Quick preset: 1k → 50k
    Normal preset: 10k → 350k
    Strong preset: 50k → 1 million
Core engine improvements:
    Continuation history - track move quality (higher priority for better moves)
    Stockfish 10's best move change tracking
    Adaptive exploration
        Dynamic c_puct based on node statistics
        Move number scaling (Stockfish-style reductions)
    Root enhancements
        Aspiration windows
        Temperature decay schedule

Evaluation improvements:
    Tapered evaluation system
    Added material imbalance evaluation
    Enhanced bishop pair with wing pawn bonuses
    … (previse za pisat detaljno - Stockfish 10 as reference)

Tests updates:
    Added 28 new tests: https://github.com/johnbergbom/Amundsen/blob/master/testsuites/bs2830.epd
*Todo: Improve tests by look at top 3 moves and comparing evaluation to stockfish

Benchmark implementation:
    Implemented comparison benchmarks between the CPU and GPU versions
